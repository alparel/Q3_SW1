		<h4>Synopsis</h4>
		<hr>
		<p style="margin-right: 10px;" class="text-justify">Hachiman Hikigaya is an apathetic and narcissistic high school student who lacks motivation. He believes that carefree youth is nothing but a charade and that anyone who claims otherwise is only deluding themselves.
		Hachiman's teacher makes him join the Volunteer Service Club as a punishment for writing an essay ridiculing modern social connections; the club's mission is to lend a helping hand to any student who requests it in order to pursue their objectives. Hachiman finds himself dealing with other people's problems on the front lines, which is a position he never imagined he would be in since the only other club member is the stunning ice queen Yukino Yukinoshita. As Hachiman and Yukino use their wits to address the issues of several students, Will Hachiman's skewed perspective on society end up being a hindrance or a tool he can utilize to his advantage?</p>
